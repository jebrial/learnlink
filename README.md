# LearnLink: a way to organize links to online study topics.
===========================================================

I have been doing a lot of studying online and I am constantly looking at sites like coursea, udacity, khan academy, and any free online resources for learning.  I have problems keeping track of all the topics I study. It can be hard to keep track of all the sites I visit since they are "no commitment" learning tools and I am using them to explore a vast amount of topics.

LearnLink will hopefully solve this problem. The basic idea is to allow you to manually enter a course name, some urls, notes, and then be able to keep track of progress based on priority and checkoff times.

Do give an idea of how this works: 

Let's say you have added a few courses.  

1. You will be able to order them how you please.

2. You will be able to set a checkoff expire time: This will allow you to hide the one you finished and it will reappear after the checkoff time expires. This is a key feature to keep you on track to move to a new topic or keep revisiting a topic based on expire time.

3. You will be able to add notes: This will allow you to remind yourself where you left off or maybe just add some thoughts on a specific course.

4. You will be able to add urls: These could be links to the course itself or maybe related topics.

5. (v2 features post hackathon to come)
